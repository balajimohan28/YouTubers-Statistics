		<p>How do I work?</p>
		<h2>Since, I am a cross-filter dashboard, all the charts are inter-linked with each other</h2>	
        <h2>Don't search for filter button, my shapes themselves are filters ;)</h2>
        <h2>Please be gentle with selecting filters, afterall I am made in D3 not python to show you the results spontaneously</h2>
        <h2>Keep calm and wait for the most trended videos after selecting the categories and channels, since streaming consumes few seconds</h2>
        <h2>And please stop looking for filters in monthly income chart, that's just a static report for the channel income</h2>
        <h2>By default, the top 10 trending bar and annaual income report are already filtered to show US' Film & Animation categor and HBO channel, as I watch HBO a lot :P</h2>
